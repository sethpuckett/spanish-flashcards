# Seth's Spanish Flashcards
![App Screenshot](img/app-screenshot-01.png "App Screenshot")

My name is Seth and these are my Spanish flashcards. This application is based on my general-purpose flaschard app, which you can find [here](https://github.com/sethpuckett/flashcards).

When I started learning Spanish the big problem I had with other flashcard apps was that they were too slow to use and there was too much clutter on the screen. I didn't want to be dragging the mouse all over the place or waiting for flip animations, etc. I wanted to be able to flip, remove, and shuffle cards as quickly as possible so that I wasn't wasting time on words I already knew well and could focus on the ones that were giving me trouble.

The big benefit of this app is that all the commands are available via keyboard shortcuts. Once you get the hang of them you can blaze through your study sessions without spending a lot of time on words & concepts that you've already got down. Additionally, there isn't a lot of onscreen clutter (ads, etc.) to distract you while studying.

## User Guide

### Selecting a Deck

Select a deck from the dropdown menu and press `Load Deck` to begin. This will display all the cards in the deck. By default the English column will be hidden and the Spanish column will be visible.

### Commands

When a deck is loaded you can interact with the application via mouse, tap, or keyboard commands.

There are several buttons available on the UI to interact with the deck:
* **Show English**: Reveal all cards in the English column (and hide the Spanish)
* **Show Spanish**: Reveal all cards in the Spanish column (and hide the English)
* **Hide All**: Hide all cards
* **Show All**: Reveal all cards
* **Shuffle Cards**: Shuffle the deck (non-ignored cards only) and move the selection to the first card
* **Show Deck Notes**: Reveal any notes associated with the deck; this button is only visible if there are deck notes associated with the current deck

Individual cards can be managed via the mouse or tap:
* Clicking a card will hide or reveal it
* Clicking the '**X**' button will remove the row from the deck and send it to the list of 'Ignored' cards (at the bottom of the page)
* Clicking the '**^**' button for an ignored row will send it back into the deck

The fastest way to interact with the flashcards (once you get used to it) is via the keyboard shortcuts:
* **A**: Hide or reveal the English card in the selected row; same as clicking the card
* **S**: Hide or reveal the Spanish card in the selected row; same as clicking the card
* **D**: Hide or reveal the notes card in the selected row; same as clicking the card
* **F**: Remove the selected row from the deck and send it to the list of 'Ignored' cards; same as clicking the '**X**' button
* **G**: Send the last 'Ignored' row back into the deck; this is useful as an 'undo' operation when cards are accidentally ignored
* **H**: Shuffle the deck and move the selection to the first card; same as clicking the **Shuffle Cards** button
* **E**: Change the selection to the previous row
* **R**: Change the selection to the next row
* **Z**: Show English column only; same as clicking the **Show English** button
* **X**: Show Spanish column only; same as clicking the **Show Spanish** button
* **C**: Hide all cards; same as clicking the **Hide All** button
* **V**: Show all cards; same as clicking the **Show All** button

On the bottom-left of the screen is a **Switch Theme** button that allows you to switch between light and dark themes. This is purely cosmetic and has no effect on functionality.
